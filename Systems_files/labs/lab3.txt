Between point A-B
	6. A larger chunk of memory is being allocated (*bigger) using calloc.
	Calloc initializes the bytes to 0 within that chunk of memory, malloc doesn't initialize
	the bytes.
	
	Call for loop is swapping the elements from smaller array into larger.
	
	int *tmp = array is assigning the pointer tmp to the initial array value (&a[0])
	
	array is being set equal to bigger
	
	bigger = first item in array becuase set equal to *tmp
	
	bigger deallocated
	
	
	7. When ran it says segmentation fault(core dumped).
	This occurs because there is no user input from the command prompt, so the pointer
	*argv returns null and theres no error handling for it
